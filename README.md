# coursera_portfolio_project

This is a Coursera exercise to create a homepage for a fictional client.  I chose the 'Lucky Shrub' client for this exercise.  

The homepage should meet the following guidelines - 

**Visual layout**

When viewing the home page in the browser:

* Is it clear that this is a home page for one of the four fictional clients?

* Is the correct company logo at the top of the page?

* Is there a horizontal navigation menu with four links below the logo?

* Does one of the links in the navigation menu link to the home page itself?

* Does the main content contain a large promotional banner at the top and three columns below it, each containing an image and some text?

* Does the page have a footer that is split into two columns?

* Does the left column of the footer contain a small version of the client logo and the right column copyright text?

**Semantic structure**

When opening the HTML file in VS Code, does it contain:

* A header element for the logo?

* A nav element for the navigation menu?

* A main element for the content?

* A footer element for the footer?

* Appropriate usage of other semantic tags such as article and section in the content of the main element?

  

**CSS layout, styling and effects**

When viewing the home page in the browser:

* Is the use of CSS styling effective?

* Is CSS used to create appropriate interactivity?

* When opening the CSS file in VS code, ask yourself the following:

* Is it a grid or flexbox layout?

* Does it have the appropriate selectors to style elements?

* Does it specify any pseudo-classes to create interactivity on the home page?

* Are any animations or transition effects used? Do they improve the user experience or distract from it?

**Overall effect of the home page**

* Does the home page create adequate interaction and a pleasing visual experience that is fitting for the client and its customers? 

* Are CSS styling and effects used effectively to create intentional engagement? 

* What works well? 

* What advice can you give to improve the user experience, layout and visuals of the home page?
